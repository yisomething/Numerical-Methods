* Q&A 
</br>Part1 Q2 Are the results close enough to be useful in the optimization?</br>
Yes, the results are close enough as tested.

Why would you use this finite-difference approximation instead of the analytic derivative? </br>
Some derivatives need a large amount of calculations and they are hard to be calculated, so we use this finite-difference approximation.

Q4 How does Broyden's compare to Newton?</br>
Newton's method is more accurate and faster. However, Broyden somethimes can deal with problem that Newton cannot.


## part2:
