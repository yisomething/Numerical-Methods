What degrees polynomial "fits" reasonably each of the cases m=0.5, 1, 2, 3 above?
n = 10, 11, 11, 11 respectively.

How does the polynomial compare with the true sin function?
Inbetween sample points?
They are similar.

Outside the samples interval? (note the "2^(1/n)" in X_new =(0:0.1:2^(1/n)*m*pi)' )
They are not quite similar.
